          <h3>Curriculum Themes: Mathematics&nbsp;<a href="#footnotes"><sup>ii</sup></a></h3>
          <p>The curriculum themes are found throughout the Mathematics curriculum. These themes are present throughout
            the Numeracy components of the FSA and consist of the following:</p>
          <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
            <li>Number represents and describes quantity</li>
            <li>Computational fluency requires a strong sense of number.</li>
            <li>Patterns represent identified regularities and form generalizations.</li>
            <li>Spatial relationships can be described, measured, and compared.</li>
            <li>Analyzing data and chance enables us to compare and interpret.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Reading Content: Text Types</h3>
          <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
            <li>Information Text and Literacy Text</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Degree of Difficulty</h3>
          <p>The FSA Item Degree of Difficulty (DIFF; Df) estimate is simply the percentage of students who answer an
            item correctly. In this case, it is also equal to the item mean. An item answered correctly for between 100%
            and 90% of students (i.e., 1.0 to 0.9) is described as <b>Very Easy</b>. Similarly, an item answered
            correctly for between 90% and 70% of students is described as <b>Moderately Easy</b>; between 70% and 50% of
            students is described as <b>Moderately Difficult</b>; between 50% and 30% of students is described as
            <b>Very Difficult</b>; and, between 30% and 0% of students is described as <b>Extremely Difficult</b>.</p>
          <h3>Depth of Knowledge (DOK) / Cognitive levels</h3>
          Cognitive level categorizes questions according to the complexity of thinking required to successfully
          complete them. Student responses provide opportunity to evaluate the student’s ability to comprehend and
          communicate. Students demonstrate understanding at three cognitive levels of Webb's Depths of Knowledge.
          <h3>DOK Reading</h3>
          <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
            <li>
              <h4>Level 1 Recall Reading</h4>
              <p>The reader uses simple skills to retrieve or locate information from the text. The responses require
                only literal understanding of text presented and often consist of verbatim recall from text, or simple
                understanding of a single word or phrase.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Level 2 Skills and Concepts Reading</h4>
              <p>The reader shows initial comprehension and subsequent processing of text or portions of text. The
                reader understands important concepts and literal main ideas.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Level 3 Strategic Thinking Reading</h4>
              <p>The reader applies deep knowledge to go beyond the text to explain, generalize, or connect ideas. The
                reader is able to support their thinking, making references and interpretations from the text or other
                sources.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>DOK Writing</h3>
          <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
            <li>
              <h4>Level 1 Writing Recall</h4>
              <p>The student writes or recites simple facts and basic ideas.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Level 2 Writing Skills and Concepts</h4>
              <p>The student shows evidence of some mental processing, such as beginning to connect ideas using a simple
                organizational structure. The student is engaged in first draft writing for a limited number of purposes
                and audiences. The student is beginning to connect ideas using a simple organizational structure for
                such things as composing a short, accurate summary.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Level 3 Writing Strategic Thinking</h4>
              <p>The student shows evidence of higher-level mental processing. The student is developing multi-paragraph
                compositions that may include complex sentence structures or demonstrate some synthesis and analysis.
                Revisions are made to the writing to improve precision of language used and to produce a logical
                progression of ideas.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>DOK Numeracy</h3>
          <ul class="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
            <li>
              <h4>Level 1 Numeracy Recall</h4>
              <p>The student is able to recall information such as a fact, definition, or term; use a procedure; or

            <li>
              <h4>Level 2 Numeracy Skills and Concepts</h4>
              <p>The student is able to demonstrate conceptual understanding through models and explanations, comparing
                and classifying information, or interpreting data; can make decisions on how to approach a problem.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Level 3 Numeracy Strategic Thinking</h4>
              <p>The student is able to solve a problem and explain thinking by reasoning, planning, and using evidence.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Item level Question format</h3>
          <p>There are two categories of question formats:</p>
          <p><b>Selected-response</b> questions require students to select a response from a set of options, including
            drop-down menus, drag-and-drop, multiple choice, matching, and sequencing.</p>
          <p><b>Constructed-response</b> questions require students to provide a written response. They include
            short-answer questions, extended-response questions, writing tasks, and problem-solving tasks.</p>
